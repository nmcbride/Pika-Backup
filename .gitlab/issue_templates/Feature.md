<!--
Suggesting a Feature

Please focus on the benefit that the feature should bring. Not on how it should be implemented or designed. Preferably, you describe what you actually wanted to do and why, when you noticed that Pika Backup is lacking the feature.

DO: I wanted to find a repository from one year ago but had to scroll down a very long list.

DON'T: Put a button at the top of the list to show repositories of the last year.

If you have an idea about how to implement the feature, feel free to share the idea as a comment to your issue. However, the design idea might be completely overthrown.
